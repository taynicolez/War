#Python Two-Player game (WAR)
#Lab 8 John, Grace, and Taylor 

#This game is a terminal version of the card game "war"

#suggestions: case sensitive (done), GUI, description of game (done), theme music (game of thrones preferred), add a quit option (done).

print("Welcome to 'War - The Card Game'\n\nWar is a very simple card game for two players. Much like real war, it's incredibly long and pointless...\n")
print("Rules:")
print("1. Each player is dealt half the deck (26 cards), face down.")
print("2. Both players turn their top card face up at the same time. The person with the higher card wins that draw, and takes both the cards.")
print("3. If both players draw a card of the same rank, e.g. they both draw 8s, then there's a war. The face up cards are left on the table and each player puts three cards face down on the table, and then puts one card face up. The face up card determines who wins the war and gets all 10 cards that are on the table at this point.")
